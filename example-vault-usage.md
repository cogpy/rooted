# Example Vault Usage

This is a demonstration file showing how the Obsidian vault-style bracket links work.

## Core Concepts

The repository explores [[nesting-branching|nesting and branching]] operations that form the algebraic foundation of rooted trees.

- [[rootrees/README]] - Implementation details

## Mathematical Background

The algebra of rooted trees connects to several domains:

- **Combinatorics**: See [[topologically-distinct]] for details on distinct tree structures
- **Geometry**: Check [[geometric-ladder]] for geometric interpretations
- **P-Systems**: Learn about [[p-system-trees]] and membrane computing

## Implementation Details

The optimized implementation is described in [[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY]].

For specific mathematical formulations, see [[math-nest-branch]].

## Neural Networks

The connection to neural networks is explored in [[membrane-neural-nets]].

For the one-to-many relationship concepts, see [[one-many]].

This file demonstrates how bracket-style links create a logical graph structure that complements the physical folder hierarchy.
